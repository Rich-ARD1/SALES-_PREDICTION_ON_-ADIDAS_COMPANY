In the footwear industry, sales forecasting is a crucial topic that has lately been quite popular as a means of improving efficiency and market operations thanks to new technology. 
Although the business has historically concentrated on a standard statistical model, machine learning approaches have gained increasing attention recently. 
The following issues are addressed by this research: a number of dataset anomalies, ineffective methods, underperforming regions, low-selling products, seasonal fluctuations, and poor sales. 
An experiment will be carried out to ascertain the best algorithm for sales forecasting. 
The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to develop a sales forecast model. 
The dataset for this study was taken from the Kaggle database, preprocessed, and then machine learning algorithms—such as Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Simple Linear Regression—that were predicted to do well on the challenges were taken into consideration. 
An experiment evaluates the algorithms' efficacy. 
Following the algorithms' assessment, the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R^2 scores were used as evaluation measures. 
With an accuracy score of 99.9% for Random Forest Regression, 95.7% for Simple Linear Regression, and 99.8% for Decision Tree Regressor, it is clear from these results that Random Forest Regression is the most appropriate approach when compared to the other methods. 
After the experiment was over, the Random Forest Regression approach performed well when compared to other methods. 
Because of this, it's believed that the Random Forest Regression is the best technique for estimating product sales.
